# Open-core boundary and licensing

This page states what is open source, the contribution licensing bar, and the trademark
reservation. It is deliberately minimal and honest: it describes only what exists today.

## What is open source

Everything in this repository is open source under the Apache License 2.0 (see the `LICENSE`
file at the repository root). This includes `chorus-core`, `chorus-server`, the configuration
format, the tool adapters, and all documentation. You can run, modify, and redistribute it
under the terms of Apache 2.0.

## Open-core boundary

chorus is developed open-core. The boundary is simple and stated up front:

- This repository is the open-source project, Apache 2.0, in full.
- There is NO hosted or commercial offering of chorus today. If a hosted or commercial
  offering is built in the future, it will be a SEPARATE product with its own terms; it is
  not part of this repository and is not implied by anything here.

chorus is built and maintained by Paperclip.inc, which operates a managed Paperclip cloud.
chorus runs inside that cloud as one component, but the project here stands on its own and
runs against any OpenAI-compatible backend. We will not list commercial features that do not
exist. When and if a commercial offering of chorus exists, this page will be updated to
describe the boundary concretely, and the no-unverified-claims rule (CLAUDE.md) applies to
that description too.

## Contribution licensing: DCO, not CLA

Contributions are accepted under the Developer Certificate of Origin
(https://developercertificate.org/), signed off per commit with `git commit -s`. See
CONTRIBUTING.md for the mechanics and the DCO check.

We do NOT require a Contributor License Agreement. The DCO is the open-core-friendly choice:
it certifies provenance and keeps the contribution bar low, without assigning copyright or
granting relicensing rights to a single entity. Contributions stay under the repository's
Apache 2.0 license.

## Trademark

The "chorus" name and any associated marks are reserved; see TRADEMARKS.md. The open-source
code license (Apache 2.0) does not grant trademark rights.
